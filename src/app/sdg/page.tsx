                            According to the World Health Organization, more than 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with feces, and more than 800,000 people die each year from diarrheal diseases linked to unsafe water and sanitation.

                            Pakistan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, facing a severe water crisis due to climate change, population growth, urbanization, pollution, mismanagement and lack of awareness. According to the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources, Pakistan may run out of water by 2025 if no urgent action is taken.

                            That’s why Paani is committed to contributing to one of the most important global goals: SDG 6. SDG 6 stands for Sustainable Development Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

                            SDG 6 is one of the 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

                            SDG 6 has eight targets and 11 indicators that aim to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation and hygiene; improve water quality and reduce pollution; increase water-use efficiency and ensure freshwater supplies; implement integrated water resources management; protect and restore water-related ecosystems; expand international cooperation and capacity-building; and support and strengthen the participation of local communities .

                            Paani’s mission is not only to provide temporary relief where they can, but to work toward building permanent solutions against the most complex problems that Pakistan is facing. They strive to combine scientific research with cultural competency to ensure that community members feel comfortable and empowered in their presence.

                            Paani’s philosophy is twofold: transparency and sustainability. Transparency to their donors on how they optimize their donations. And a promise of sustainable interventions to the communities they serve.
